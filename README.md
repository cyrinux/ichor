# Talos Viewer

Website: <https://cyrinux.github.io/talosdev-mobile/>

Android and iOS app for a [Talos](https://www.talos.dev) cluster:

- **Viewing:** node status, services, resources, logs, etcd and the cluster health check.
- **Actions:** reboot or shut down a node.
- **Kubernetes:** export a kubeconfig to open the cluster in kubenav.
- **Background:** alerts and a home-screen widget.
- **Protection:** optional fingerprint/PIN lock.

The Talos API layer is the official Go client (`siderolabs/talos/pkg/machinery`, same code as
`talosctl`) compiled with gomobile, so talosconfig parsing, Ed25519 mTLS and endpoint→node
proxying behave exactly like `talosctl`.

**Install on Android:**

- **[Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev)** installs and updates the app straight from this
  repository's GitHub releases. The button above pre-fills it, with a filter that skips
  unsigned APKs.
- **Manually:** download `talosdev-mobile-v<version>-<abi>.apk` from the
  [latest release](https://github.com/cyrinux/talosdev-mobile/releases/latest); `arm64-v8a`
  fits almost all phones.

**F-Droid:** not listed yet. The planned route is [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/),
an F-Droid repository that ships the signed release APKs.

## Features and the talosconfig role they need

Talos enforces access with the roles baked into the talosconfig client certificate. The app
reads those roles and explains up front when a feature needs more.

| Feature | Talos API | Minimum role |
|---|---|---|
| Cluster overview (readiness, stage, version, role) | `Version`, COSI resources | `os:reader` |
| Node services and resources | `ServiceList`, `Memory`, `LoadAvg`, `SystemStat`, `CPUInfo`, `Mounts` | `os:reader` |
| Service logs and kernel log (dmesg) | `Logs`, `Dmesg` | `os:reader` |
| etcd members, leader, DB size, alarms | `EtcdMemberList`, `EtcdStatus`, `EtcdAlarmList` | `os:reader` |
| Background alerts and widget | same as the overview and etcd | `os:reader` |
| **Reboot (`-m default\|powercycle\|force`) / shutdown (`--force`)** | `Reboot`, `Shutdown` | **`os:operator`** |
| **Cluster health check** | `ClusterService/HealthCheck` | **`os:admin`** |
| **Kubeconfig export** | `Kubeconfig` | **`os:admin`** |

Notes:

- **Source:** the rules come from Talos v1.14 (`internal/app/machined/pkg/system/services/machined.go`).
- **Health check:** the call itself is allowed for `os:reader`. Talos then runs the check with the
  caller's roles, and the Kubernetes checks need an admin kubeconfig. With a lower role, the
  overview and etcd screens give the same node and etcd picture.
- **Roles combine:** an `os:operator` config can do everything an `os:reader` one can.

### Creating a talosconfig for the phone

Generate a dedicated identity instead of copying your admin `~/.talos/config`. If the phone is
lost, its certificate only grants what you chose, and it expires on its own.

`talosctl config new` needs exactly one node to sign the certificate: use a control-plane node.

```sh
CP=10.0.0.2   # any control-plane node

# Monitoring only (recommended default):
talosctl -n $CP config new talosconfig-phone --roles os:reader --crt-ttl 8760h

# Monitoring + reboot/shutdown:
talosctl -n $CP config new talosconfig-phone --roles os:operator --crt-ttl 8760h

# Everything, including the health check and kubeconfig export (treat the phone like a laptop):
talosctl -n $CP config new talosconfig-phone --roles os:admin --crt-ttl 8760h
```

Check what was generated. The app queries the context's `nodes`, falling back to its
`endpoints` when the list is empty, so make sure every node is listed:

```sh
talosctl --talosconfig talosconfig-phone config info
talosctl --talosconfig talosconfig-phone config node 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3 ...   # all nodes
talosctl --talosconfig talosconfig-phone -n $CP version                                # sanity check
```

The `talosconfig*` filenames are gitignored in this repository.

**Renewal:** the certificate lasts `--crt-ttl` (default one year). Settings shows the expiry
date. When background alerts are on, the app notifies daily from 14 days before expiry. To
renew, generate a new file and import it (Settings → Import a new talosconfig).

### Importing it

Pick one of these:

- **File:** `adb push talosconfig-phone /sdcard/Download/`, then choose it in the app.
- **Paste:** paste the YAML.
- **QR code:** run `qrencode -r talosconfig-phone -o talosconfig.png` and scan it. This works
  for configs up to about 2.9 KB.

Delete `talosconfig.png` and the copy in `Download/` afterwards; both contain the private key.
The app stores the config AES-GCM encrypted with an Android Keystore key, excluded from backups.

## Safety features

- **Reboot / shutdown:** the same options as talosctl, from the Talos v1.14 sequencer:

  | Option | What happens |
  |---|---|
  | Reboot `default` | Stop pods and services, then reboot (kexec fast reboot when available). No cordon/drain. |
  | Reboot `powercycle` | Same graceful stop, then a full firmware reboot instead of kexec. |
  | Reboot `force` | Reboot immediately, with no pod or service shutdown. Only for a stuck node. |
  | Shutdown `--force` | Skip the Kubernetes cordon/drain, e.g. when the API is down. Pods and services are still stopped. |

  Every option goes through the same confirmation:
  1. You type the node's hostname to confirm.
  2. Control-plane nodes get an etcd-quorum warning.
  3. With the app lock on, you also authenticate with fingerprint or PIN.
- **App lock (Settings → Security):**
  - **Methods:** fingerprint, with the device PIN, pattern or password as fallback.
  - **When it asks:** at launch, after 30 s in the background, and before reboot, shutdown and kubeconfig export.
  - **Privacy:** it hides the app in recent apps and blocks screenshots, unless you turn on
    "Allow screenshots", which also requires authenticating.
  - **Changing it:** turning it on or off requires authenticating.
- **Notifications:** with the app lock on, alerts show only a generic text on the lock screen.
  The widget shows counts only, no hostnames.
- **Kubeconfig export:** the kubeconfig is written only to the file you choose. kubenav has no
  app-to-app import, so add the cluster from that file in kubenav, then delete the file.

## Updates

The Android app updates itself from this repository's GitHub releases (Settings → Updates):

- **When it checks:** once a day, or when you tap "Check now".
- **What it downloads:** the signed APK for the phone's ABI, after you confirm.
- **Verification before installing:**
  1. the SHA-256 checksum GitHub publishes for the file;
  2. the package name;
  3. that it is signed with exactly the installed app's key.
- **Installing:** Android shows its own confirmation, and asks once to allow
  "Install unknown apps" for Talos Viewer.

Updates only work between builds signed with the same key, which means CI release builds with
the `TALOS_KEYSTORE*` secrets set. A **debug** build, signed with your machine's debug key,
cannot be replaced by a release. To switch once:

1. uninstall the debug build;
2. install `talosdev-mobile-vX.Y.Z-<abi>.apk` from a release;
3. re-import the talosconfig.

There is no self-update on iOS, where sideloaded apps are reinstalled with Sideloadly or AltStore.

## Build

APKs are split per ABI (`arm64-v8a` for almost all phones, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`), with
compressed native libraries. A release APK is about 16 MB.

```sh
./build.sh            # debug APKs -> app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-<abi>-debug.apk
./build.sh release    # needs TALOS_KEYSTORE, TALOS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, TALOS_KEY_ALIAS, TALOS_KEY_PASSWORD
just install           # builds, then installs the APK matching the connected device's ABI
```

- **Default toolchain:** Nix (`flake.nix`). `BUILDER=docker ./build.sh` uses `build/Dockerfile`
  instead, and `IN_CONTAINER=1 ./build.sh` runs inside that image (CI, e.g. a Forgejo runner).
- **aarch64 Linux hosts:** the Android SDK and NDK are x86_64-only, and the Go runtime and the
  NDK clang crash under qemu-user. `build.sh` therefore keeps Go, gomobile, the JDK and Gradle
  native:
  - gomobile is built from a patched copy, because upstream refuses linux/arm64;
  - cgo uses a native clang 18 with the NDK sysroot (`.cache/ndk`);
  - only `aapt2` runs emulated.
- **Nix sandbox:** for the x86_64 SDK builds, `build.sh` exposes the binfmt qemu closure to the
  sandbox, which requires a trusted Nix user.
- **Page size:** native libraries are linked with 16 KB page alignment, as Android 15+ requires.

Go core only (fast, native):

```sh
cd go && go test ./...
go run ./cmd/probe overview   # also: services NODE, resources NODE, logs NODE SERVICE, dmesg NODE,
                              #       etcd, health, kubeconfig (prints size only), parse
go run ./cmd/probe -config ../talosconfig-phone overview   # test a role-limited config
```

## iOS

The iOS app (`ios/`) reuses the same Go core, built as `Talosmobile.xcframework` with
gomobile, around a SwiftUI UI. The pure logic lives in the `TalosViewerCore` Swift package:
models, formatting, lock state and power-request rules.

**Feature parity with Android:**

- import from a file, by pasting, or by QR code (VisionKit);
- the config is encrypted to a Secure Enclave key (Keychain fallback without one);
- overview, node services, resources, logs and live graphs;
- etcd, KubeSpan and the cluster health check;
- reboot and shutdown with the same modes and typed confirmation;
- the debug shell (SwiftTerm terminal);
- kubeconfig export;
- background alerts and a home-screen widget;
- Face ID / passcode lock, themes, and role-based actions.

**What iOS does differently:**

- **Self-update:** not possible for sideloaded apps; reinstall new releases with Sideloadly or
  AltStore.
- **Screenshots:** iOS does not let apps block them. The app-switcher privacy cover hides the
  content instead.
- **Background alerts:** best effort. iOS decides when background checks run, and skips them
  while the device is locked, because the config cannot be decrypted then.
- **Leftover data:** Keychain items survive uninstalling the app. Use Settings → Delete to
  remove the config.
- **Widget:** shares the last check with the app through an App Group, which a free Apple ID
  may not support when sideloading. In that case the widget stays empty.

**Building:** Xcode only runs on macOS.

```sh
just ios-test-linux   # core package tests, here on Linux (Nix swift shell)
just ios-test         # macOS: xcframework + core tests + simulator build
just ios-build        # macOS: unsigned IPA in ios/build/
```

**Installing:** CI produces an unsigned IPA. Sideloadly or AltStore re-sign it with your Apple
ID: a free account means reinstalling every 7 days, a paid one lasts a year. To sign in Xcode
instead, set `TALOS_IOS_TEAM_ID` before `xcodegen generate`.

## CI (GitHub Actions)

- **`.github/workflows/android.yml`** (Ubuntu, Nix flake): `./build.sh check`, then the debug
  and release APKs.
- **`.github/workflows/ios.yml`** (macOS 15): core tests, simulator build, unsigned IPA.

Both run on pushes to `main` and on pull requests. Release APKs are named
`talosdev-mobile-v<version>-<abi>.apk`, or `…-unsigned.apk` when no keystore secrets are set;
the updater ignores unsigned ones. On a `v*` tag (`just release-tag 0.1.0`,
then `git push origin v0.1.0`), they attach the release APK and the IPA to the GitHub release.

To sign the release APK in CI, generate a key once and upload it as repository secrets:

```sh
just android-keystore-gen       # then export TALOS_KEYSTORE, TALOS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, TALOS_KEY_ALIAS
just github-secrets             # sets the three secrets below with gh (values via stdin)
```

The secrets it sets:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `TALOS_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `base64 -w0 ~/talos-viewer-release.jks` |
| `TALOS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | the keystore password |
| `TALOS_KEY_ALIAS` | the key alias, e.g. `talos-viewer` |

Without them, the release APK is unsigned.
